# End-End Model Deployment For Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction
This project is implemented to detect if a person is having a kidney disease or not.
The aim for this project is to get familiar with the entire machine learning pipeline

There are different python scripts
app.py #an app is created using flask 
main.ipnyb #in this file the data has undergone data preprocessing, data engineering, data analysis and then the model is trained on Logistic Regression alogorithm
requirements.txt #packages included which is required for the app and model
Dockerfile #A docker container is created

#Folders
models - #model.pkl file is there
templates - #all html files are present in there
.github - #there is main.yaml file which peforms deployment of app to the cloud
